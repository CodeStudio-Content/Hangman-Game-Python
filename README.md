## Code Structure

1. `choose_word(category=None)` - This function chooses a word from the list of categories given in the word_lists dictionary. If no category is provided, it selects a random one.

2. `__init__(self, word)` - This is a constructor method of the HangmanGame class which initializes various attributes like word, display_word, guesses_left, and letters_guessed. It also calls the create_gui() method to create a GUI for the game.

3. `update_display_word(self)`  - This function updates the display_word when a guessed letter is correct.

4. `guess_letter(self, letter)` - This function handles the guessing process by checking if the letter guess is right or wrong based on whether the letter appears in the word or not. If a player guesses all letters correctly, they win. If the guesses run out before the word is guessed, they lose.

5. `create_gui(self)` - This function creates the GUI elements of the game using Tkinter module.

6. `disable_buttons(self)` - This function disables all the letter buttons after the game is over.

7. `update_hangman(self)` - This function updates the hangman image based on the number of guesses left.

8. `change_category(self, category)` - This function changes the category of the word being guessed, destroying the current gui instance and creating a new instance with a fresh word and updated category.

9. `start_game(self)` - This function starts the game loop by continuously updating the window in the mainloop() call.

10. `restart_game(self)` - This function restarts the game by destroying the current GUI instance and creating a new instance with a new word.
